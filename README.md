# Image-caption-generator-using-deep-learning-
 An image caption generator uses ResNet (CNN) to extract features and LSTM (RNN) to generate captions. ResNet creates a 2048-dim feature vector from the image, which LSTM uses to predict words. Trained on datasets like Flickr8k, it learns image-text patterns to generate captions for new images.
